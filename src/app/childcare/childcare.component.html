    POTS is a “one-stop shop” assisting individuals living in poverty on their journeys from crisis to stability and ultimately, self-sufficiency. <br/><br/>
    POTS provides food, clothing, shower, hair cuts, and a safe mailing address in addition to many other vital services such as assistance with public benefits (SNAP and health insurance applications on-site), supportive housing, eviction prevention, and general advocacy. POTS also provides referrals to detox and outpatient treatment, shelters, employment, financial counseling, educational programs and more.  <br/><br/>
    POTS Family Club provides intensive case management, education, social and nutrition support to a select group of families. In addition to weekly meetings with a case manager, families gather once a week in the Community Dining Room. During this time, tutors provide homework assistance to children while their caregivers receive a lesson in nutrition and work with a professional chef to prepare a healthful and novel meal. At the end of each class, the children, caregivers and tutors come back together to share the meal. Highly-engaged families may also be eligible for holiday and special distributions. If you are interested in participating or would like more information, email the Family Club Coordinator at familyclub@potsbronx.org. <br/><br/>
    New clients are encouraged to visit POTS Single Stop Intake Coordinator to learn more about and enroll in POTS services. The meeting will include a benefits screening. You can meet with the Single Stop Intake Coordinator Monday through Friday 9:00-11:55 am for the Food Pantry or 1:00-4:00 pm for Case Management and Legal Clinic.<br/><br/>
