    The Crisis Intervention Program can help you get connected to domestic violence services and homelessness prevention on a walk-in basis. For the past 30 years, the Coalition’s Crisis Intervention Program has been a singular refuge, where anyone in New York who is homeless, on the brink of homelessness or struggling to survive can receive immediate help from experienced and dedicated frontline staff. The program provides a full spectrum of services and support to up to 50 households per day, including access to decent emergency shelter, obtaining food stamps and other vital benefits, and longer-term assistance to secure housing.
    <br/><br/>
    The Crisis Intervention Program operates Monday – Friday on a first-come, first-serve basis. Make sure to arrive at the Coalition no later than 8:00 am to see a case manager.  <br/><br/>
