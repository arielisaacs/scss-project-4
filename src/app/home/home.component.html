    Based on true events and cast entirely with real people, HOLD ME DOWN depicts a day in the life of a 19-year-old single mother in the Bronx who works as a stripper at an illegal nightclub to support her child. It is inspired by the experiences of Unique Adams, a young mother who invited writer/director Niclas Gillis into her world to portray the reality that she faces. It is filmed in the locations where the events depicted actually occur, and produced with the participation of the local community. As such, the film becomes  an untainted window into a life lead by millions of women in the shadows of mainstream America. In the words of Carole Dean: (President of the Roy W. Dean Film Grants) “There has never been a film like this before. It is really in a category of its own.”
