    <h2 class="title">THE FILM</h2>
    Based on true events, Hold Me Down depicts a day in the life of a 19-year-old single mother who works as a stripper at an illegal nightclub to support her child in the South Bronx. It is filmed in the locations where the events depicted actually occurred; in the Mott Haven Housing Projects and in an actual brothel, and features a cast of non-actors / women survivors of sexual exploitation and domestic violence.
  </div>
  <div class="words">
    Written, directed, and edited by Niclas Gillis, Hold Me Down was produced by More Media, Bob Film Sweden, and The Collectif. It was made with support from The Swedish Film Institute, Sveriges Television and IFP. Following its world premiere at the Gothenburg International Film Festival, Hold Me Down has been celebrated for its authoritative realism and the outstanding performances of the cast.

      “Containing what maybe the most perfect set of performances ever to grace the screen, this film is - on a performance level - unlike anything you've ever seen. The actors are not acting; they are living out their lives, since all of the women are non-actors from the South Bronx. I have never seen performances such as these, and neither have you. They put all of Hollywood to shame.”</span>

    Swedish writer-director Niclas Gillis first became aware of the harsh conditions faced by women in poverty in the United States in 2009, when a classmate invited him to what he thought would to be a regular house party in Harlem, but that proved to be an illicit event similar to the one depicted in the film. He was nineteen years old and what he witnessed shocked him to the extent that he would spend the next five years researching the issue, and the subsequent three making a film addressing it, taking up residence in the area to do so.

      “We wanted the women who really live this life to have the opportunity to tell their own story, to raise awareness of the conditions that they face, and inspire change”
    </span>

    , Gillis says. Thanks to a partnership with <a href='http://www.projectrousseau.org/' target='_blank'>Project Rousseau</a>, the women involved have since been able to gain stability in their lives and are now pursuing higher education.

      “Hold Me Down is a gritty, brilliantly trail-blazing, and profoundly bold punch to the gut in the form of a short film and an eloquent testament to the cathartic power of cinema as a medium. It is really ESSENTIAL cinema for anyone who cares for their fellow human beings and is motivated to help better their lives and ease their suffering.”
